				Here I`m explaining why I want to work in software development. 
				The last major advance in IT was the networking of almost all computers in the world. 
				Thus, if you wanted to develop something, you no longer had to go to the library, 
				but could get the required information directly from the Internet which is always 
				updated with new knowledge. I`m believing in that the next big development is automation 
				of almost everything. Where previously millions of people were employed in bookkeeping, 
				computers are now taking on more and more of the organizational work. 
				The principle can also be applied to industry if you consider that many factories are 
				already producing fully automatic except for maintenance work. 
				I think it's a nice thought that a lot of monotonous jobs will be eliminated and people 
				can devote themselves to more creative work. I would like to make a contribution 
				on this path by developing special software.
				<br><br>
				I don't think IT is an industry where you learn once and then you do the same 
				thing for the whole life. This is exactly why I`m excited about information 
				technology. You can and must constantly develop yourself. New technologies are 
				constantly being added which may take time at the beginning but which ultimately 
				save significantly more time after implementation. My goal for the future is 
				therefore to go in the direction of the full stack developer, if it makes 
				sense to still use some hardware-related programming to connect, for 
				example household appliances or machines to the Internet. 
				<br><br>
				On many websites of companies with IT departments there is often the question 
				asked why one applies to this company in particular. This question might 
				be a little premature at the first contact. If I could choose a company, 
				I would do it based on two aspects. First the social aspect. Does your 
				company rely on teamwork or does the management think that competition 
				stimulates business? A good collegial cooperation and mutual willingness 
				to help would be very important to me. And I'm would be very happy about that. 
				The second aspect is the salary and this is again difficult to assess because 
				I don't know how much I can contribute to a company.
