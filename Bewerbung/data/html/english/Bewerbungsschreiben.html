                    To whom it may concern,
                    <br><br>
					a couple of days ago I have finished my 3 year education at the "Information 
					Technology High School" and graduated with the "Allgemeine 
					Hochschulreife".
					<br><br>
					The most experience I could gain in the Java programming language. In Java,
					I know many ways to structure the code, e.g. using object-oriented with 
					classes, abstract classes and interfaces as well as static. Additionally, I`m 
					working with annotations, a docker for SQL-Light databases and a parser for 
					XML-Files. I`m able to program the databases by myself. My knowledge of 
					graphical interfaces and animations in Java is also good. I learned to work 
					with packages for CRUD applications and have basic knowledge of app 
					development with Android Studio. For the backend of servers, I worked with 
					the Spring Framework as part of an open source project. Finally, I am also 
					familiar with the Gradle build system.
                    <br><br>
					For the frontend, I know JavaScript, HTML and CSS. JavaScript including 
					Node.js. is my second most used language after Java. My second script 
					language is Python. Furthermore, I have basic knowledge of C ++, among 
					other things, I know the libraries for file operations and the principle of 
					header files and classes.
                    <br><br>
					During my education at the "Information Technology High School", I had an 
					average of 6 hours a week of computer science lessons. Especially the following
					5 areas were trained into the depth: microcontrollers, UML diagrams, 
					databases, operating systems and network technology. For UML we learned 
					class diagrams, sequence diagrams and state diagrams to use as a better 
					alternative for JavaDoc. Our database language was SQL-Light. In operating 
					systems, we have learned how data are structured in Windows and Linux and 
					what threads are. In self-education, I learned to implement them into Java. In 
					network technology, we learned something about the layers in which the 
					Internet is built up. Our microcontroller was the 8051 that I programmed with 
					Assembly and C in the Keil IDE. I also worked a bit with the Assembly 
					programming language for DOS. Finally, I'm also familiar with the Oracle 
					VM VirtualBox and have installed there a Linux-Debian distribution, so I can 
					deal with Linux.
                    <br><br>
					You can find examples for codes I programmed for most of the above skills on 
					GitHub. I perform the administration of my repositories with Git Bash. I can 
					also work with the Windows console and through this, I can write batch files.
					<br><br>
					Because, I`m very interested in computer science and I really like to program, 
					I did investigate into the depth many of the above mentioned applications by 
					myself via Internet and I could therefore increase strongly my programming 
					skills. I believe I can say of myself that I can learn well on my own. However, I 
					also like to discuss with others and to find solutions for challenging projects.
					<br><br>
					Thank you so much for taking the time to read my application! I would be 
					delighted to have the opportunity to introduce myself to you personally or by 
					Skype.
					<br><br>
					Yours faithfully,
                </div>
