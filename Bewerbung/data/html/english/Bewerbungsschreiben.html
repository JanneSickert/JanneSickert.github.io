                    Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
                    <br><br>
					a cupple of days ago I have got my graduation at the Information technology high school and got there the "allgemeine Hochschulreife".
					The most experience I have in the Java programming language. There I know many ways to structure code. object-oriented with classes, abstract classes and interfaces as well as static.
					In addition I know how to use Annotationen. I know how to use a Docker for SQL-Light databases and a parser for XML-Files.
					Of course, I can also program the databases myself. My knowledge of graphical interfaces and animations in Java are also good.
					I also know packages for CRUD applications and have basic knowledge of app development with Android Studio.
					For the backend of servers I worked with the Spring Framework as part of an open source project. I am also familiar with the Gradle build system.
                    <br><br>
                    For the frontend I know JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
					JavaScript is my second most used language after Java.
					I also know Node.js. My second script language is Python.
					Furthermore, I have basic knowledge of C ++, among other things, I know the libraries for file operations and the principle of header files and classes.
                    <br><br>
                    Now to what I learned at the technical high school. All in all, I had an average of 6 hours a week of computer science lessons over the 3 years.
					This can be divided into 5 areas: microcontrollers, UML diagrams, databases, operating systems and network technology.
					For UML we learned class diagrams, sequence diagrams and state diagrams as a better alternative to JavaDoc.
                    Our database language was SQL-Light.
					In operating systems we have learned how data are structured in Windows and Linux and what threads are. At home I learned to implement them in Java.
					In network technology we learned something about the layers in which the Internet is built up.
					Our microcontroller was the 8051 that I programmed with Assembly and C in the Keil IDE.
					I also worked a bit with the Assembly programming language for DOS.
					I'm also familiar with the Oracle VM VirtualBox and have installed there a Linux-Debian distribution so I can handle with Linux.
                    <br><br>
                    You can find sample code for most of the above skills on GitHub. The administration of my repositories do I with Git Bash.
                    I can also work with the Windows console and through this I can write batch files.
                    <br><br>
                    Since I learned most of the abovementioned skills independently over the Internet, I believe I can say of myself that I can learn well on my own.
					Thank you for taking the time to read my application.
					I would be delighted to have the opportunity to introduce myself to you personally or by Skype.
                    <br><br>
                    With best wishes
